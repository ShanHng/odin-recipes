    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A savoury Japanese pancake that is chock full of vegetables yet so good! Suitable for any occasion because it is so simple yet delishhh!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
	<i> For the pancake: </i>
        <li>1/8 of a cabbage or two good handfuls finely sliced </li>
        <li>1 spring onion white part thinly sliced (reserve the green part for garnish)</li>
	<li>1 free range egg</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon soy sauce</li>
	<li>½ cup flour</li>
	<li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    
        <br />
	<i>For the sauce:</i>
	<li>Kewpie Mayo</li>
	<li>Kecap manis or BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put cabbage, spring onion, egg, soy sauce, flour and water in a bowl and mix well to combine.</li> 
        <li>Heat a frypan over a low to medium heat and add a splash of oil for frying.</li>
        <li>Tip the okonomiyaki mixture into the pan and use a spatula to form it into a round pancake about 2cm thick. 
            Take your time cooking it - it's thick and you don't want raw mixture in the middle. When golden brown on the bottom, carefully flip and cook the other side until golden too. It's not essential, but I find it helpful to put a lid on the frypan for some of the cooking time to help it cook through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and serve immediately, or keep warm in a low oven while you cook more pancakes.</li>
        <li>Top with your choice of condiments, slice into wedges and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

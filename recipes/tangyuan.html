    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A sweet Chinese dessert that is easy to make! For sweet tooths who want something chewy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
	<i> For the rice balls: </i>
        <li>1 C Glutinous Rice Flour </li>
        <li>1/2 C Room Temperature Water</li>
    
    <br />
	<i>For the broth:</i>
	<li>6C water</li>
	<li>6TBsp Brown sugar</li>
    <li>1″ thinly sliced ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the glutinous rice flour and water together and knead until it becomes a soft ball of dough. A texture similar to playdough. It should be soft, not too sticky also not too dry that it crumbles. Add a little water if it’s too dry, a bit more rice flour if it’s too wet/sticky.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into as many color as you’d like and add your coloring to the dough! Knead and make sure the color is well-incorporated.</li>
        <li>Shape them into 1/2 inch or smaller rounds, or get creative and make some shapes! Cover the dough and finished tang yuan with a towel or keep them in a container with a lid to keep them from drying out as you’re working.</li> 
        <li>To cook the tangyuan, bring a pot of water to boil, add tang yuan to the pot and boil until all the tang yuan floats to the top- that means they’re ready!</li>
        <li>To make the broth, make a brown sugar ginger broth(6C water, 6TBsp Brown sugar, 1″ thinly sliced ginger) and bring it to a boil then add the tang yuan to cook till they float. </li>
    </ol>
